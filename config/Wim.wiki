= Plugins Guide = 
This plugins guide is not about including a Tl;Dr to every plugin! Yet it will 
cover some of the important ones that are not covered in the tables below. You 
can always check out the individual repos of each plugin and see their README

== Leaderf ==
This is one of the most useful plugins. Although fzf can also do most of these 
things, I prefer to keep them both around. 
Wim doesn't provide any mappings for leaderf, and I advise you against it! 
use leaderf from Vim's Ex Mode (command mode).

*Example:*
fuzzy match file names
`:Leaderf file`
fuzzy match history
`:Leaderf mru`
etc ...

file                search files
tag                 navigate tags using the tags file
function            navigate functions or methods in the buffer
mru                 search most recently used files
searchHistory       execute the search command in the history
cmdHistory          execute the command in the history
help                navigate the help tags
line                search a line in the buffer
colorscheme         switch between colorschemes
gtags               navigate tags using the gtags
self                execute the commands of itself
bufTag              navigate tags in the buffer
buffer              search buffers
rg                  grep using rg
filetype            navigate the filetype
command             execute built-in/user-defined Ex commands.
window              search windows.
quickfix            navigate the quickfix.
loclist             navigate the location list.

= Stargate =
Literally magic! Written in vim9script, super fast and super efficient!
 type `\f` in normal mode, followed by a character you want to jump to and 
 follow the hints.
See: https://github.com/monkoose/vim9-stargate 

= Surround =
See: https://github.com/tpope/vim-surround

= vimdict =
My own humble plugin for integrating dict cli into vim in a seamless way.

You can either place your cursor on a word and issue `:Dict`, or optionally map
it to a key:
	`nnoremap <F2> :Dict<CR>`
See: https://github.com/wolandark/vimdict

= vim-ddgpb =
Another one of my own plugins.
Yea the name is trash but its pretty useful. 
Once enabled, you can search a word under the cursor in your browser, or a
chunk of text that is visually selected. This plugin also allows you to submit
a visually selected text to the 0x0.st paste bin.

This plugin binds `\s` and `\p` and `F3` key for visual search, paste bin and 
word under cursor respectively.
See: https://github.com/wolandark/vim-ddgpb/tree/master

= vim-live-server =
